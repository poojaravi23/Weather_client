# Weather_client
 Implementation of a client application that will connect to the National Weather Service website using HTTP and XML and display current weather conditions. 
                 The client process will connect to the server over a socket connection and request weather information for a certain location. The National Weather Service 
                 specifies the location using latitude and longitude instead of zip code. The coordinates are entered into the client program and current update is obtained 
                 for that location.The following variables are displayed based on the latitude and longitude values entered: Maximum Temperature,Minimum Temperature,Dew point 
                 Temperature,Apparent Temperature,12 Hour Probability of Precipitation,Wind Speed,Wind Direction, Wave Height and Weather Icon.
